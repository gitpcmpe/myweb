   <h1>Prime number</h1>
   <p>Accoriding to Wikipedia, A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers.</p>
   <p>Also, according to www.scientificamerican.com, there is no way to predict whether a given number will be prime.</p>
   
   <p>However, I think that every prime number has its own frequency and phase as below picture. I believe a circle contains the frequency of natural number which is a prime number and composite number.</p>
   <p>Therefore, if we remove the first number one by one, we may predict next number and when it will show up by demodulating it like wireless communication. </p>

   <p>The first 25 prime numbers (all the prime numbers less than 100) are:<p>
   <p>2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97...<p>
